## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this repository.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site
    gatsby new doggo-classifier-ui https://github.com/xyzarivera/doggo-classifier-ui
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd doggo-classifier-ui/
    npm install package.json
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
